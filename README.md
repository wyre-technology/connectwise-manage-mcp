**Let your AI assistant work directly with ConnectWise Manage.** Search tickets, log time, look up companies and contacts, manage projects — through natural conversation instead of clicking through the CWM interface.

This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives Claude (or any MCP-compatible AI) 34 tools covering the daily operations ConnectWise Manage shops depend on. Works with both **cloud-hosted and self-hosted** CWM instances — just point it at your server.

> **Part of the [MSP Claude Plugins](https://github.com/wyre-technology/msp-claude-plugins) ecosystem** — a growing suite of AI integrations for the MSP stack including [Autotask](https://github.com/wyre-technology/autotask-mcp), [Datto RMM](https://github.com/wyre-technology/datto-rmm-mcp), [IT Glue](https://github.com/wyre-technology/itglue-mcp), [HaloPSA](https://github.com/wyre-technology/halopsa-mcp), [NinjaOne](https://github.com/wyre-technology/ninjaone-mcp), [Huntress](https://github.com/wyre-technology/huntress-mcp), and more. Built by MSPs, for MSPs.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CW_MANAGE_COMPANY_ID` | Yes | Your ConnectWise company identifier |
| `CW_MANAGE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Yes | API member public key |
| `CW_MANAGE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | API member private key |
| `CW_MANAGE_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | Client ID from [ConnectWise Developer Portal](https://developer.connectwise.com/) |
| `CW_MANAGE_URL` | No | API base URL (see below) |
| `CW_MANAGE_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` | No | Set to `false` for self-signed certs (default: `true`) |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | No | `stdio` (default) or `http` |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | No | HTTP port (default: `8080`) |
| `AUTH_MODE` | No | `env` (default) or `gateway` for header-based auth |

### API Base URL (`CW_MANAGE_URL`)

| Instance Type | URL |
|---------------|-----|
| Cloud (North America) | `https://api-na.myconnectwise.net` (default) |
| Cloud (Europe) | `https://api-eu.myconnectwise.net` |
| Cloud (Australia) | `https://api-au.myconnectwise.net` |
| **Self-hosted** | `https://cwm.yourcompany.com` |

For self-hosted instances, set `CW_MANAGE_URL` to your server's base URL. The server automatically appends `/v4_6_release/apis/3.0` unless the URL already contains that path.

If your self-hosted instance uses a self-signed certificate, also set `CW_MANAGE_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false`.

### Getting Your API Keys

1. Log in to your ConnectWise Manage instance
2. Navigate to **System > Members > API Members**
3. Create a new API member with appropriate permissions
4. Generate API keys for the member
5. Get your Client ID from the [ConnectWise Developer Portal](https://developer.connectwise.com/)
